# 🚀 Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Analysis Platform

> **End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project** using Azure Event Hub, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2), Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, dbt, Apache Airflow, SQL, and Power BI.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline that ingests streaming social media data, processes it using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), performs analytics transformations, and delivers interactive dashboards for business insights.

The solution is designed to simulate a production-grade Azure data platform with real-time ingestion, scalable data processing, orchestration, monitoring, and reporting.

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

The low-level design describes the detailed implementation of the pipeline, including:

* Event Hub streaming ingestion
* PySpark Structured Streaming
* Bronze Delta tables
* Silver transformation layer
* dbt Gold models
* Airflow orchestration

# ⚙ How Data Enters the Pipeline

### Step 1

Python Event Producer scripts continuously read CSV datasets.

Examples:

* Tweets
* Sentiment
* Trends
* User Metadata
* Valid Tweets

---

### Step 2

The producer publishes events into Azure Event Hub.

Each dataset is sent to its corresponding Event Hub.

Example:

```
Tweets
      ↓
tweet-hub

Sentiment
      ↓
sentiment-hub

Trends
      ↓
trends-hub
```

---

### Step 3

Azure Databricks Structured Streaming continuously consumes Event Hub events.

The streaming pipeline processes records in near real time.

---

### Step 4

Raw records are stored in the **Bronze Layer** as Delta tables.

---

### Step 5

PySpark transforms the Bronze data into the **Silver Layer** by applying:

* Duplicate removal
* Null handling
* Standardization
* Data validation
* Business rules
* Schema enforcement

---

### Step 6

dbt creates analytics-ready Gold tables.

These include:

* Fact tables
* Dimension tables
* Aggregate tables

---

### Step 7

Power BI connects to Gold tables to create dashboards.

---
